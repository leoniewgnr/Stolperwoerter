# Stolperwörter

A fun German word game that challenges players to read tricky compound words correctly! 🎯 

## About the Game

Stolperwörter (German for "stumbling words") is a social party game where players try to correctly pronounce tricky German compound words. These words are specifically chosen because they can be misread or misinterpreted at first glance, often with hilarious results!

The idea for this game emerged during a Christmas dinner in 2024, when my brother came up with the idea to play a word game. We started laughing and the spontaneous creation of this app! 🎄

### How to Play

1. Hold up your phone so others can see the displayed word
2. Players try to read the word correctly on their first attempt
3. Tap the screen to get the next word
4. Laugh together at the funny mistakes! 😄
